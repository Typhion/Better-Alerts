[h1] Description [/h1]
Adds a lot of Alerts to be more visible instead of in the current situation thingy. Also makes it so the current situation thingy doesn't light up when there are unread messages. The alerts are fully colour coded and toggleable. Decisions also have a system of being individually toggled.

[h2] Features [/h2]
[list]
    [*] Custom gui elements for alerts
    [*] Made all alerts toggleable (Open toggle menu by right-clicking Current Situation Toggle or right-click an alert to disable it)
    [*] Changed the little glow on the alerts to be less annoying
    [*] Fully colour coded Alerts
    [*] Decisions are individually toggleable now by right-clicking on them
    [*] Added a menu for alerts that required you to be able to check multiple things (such as states, generals, etc.)

If you are willing to translate this to one of the available languages then leave a comment. Currently there is an English placeholder for every language so that it doesn't just show the loc key.
